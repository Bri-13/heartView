Prompt: 
make the rpi process this: Differentiate signal to determine sharp peaks identify local maxes over a period of time Calculate time between detected peaks Determine heart rate: number of heart beats / period of time Irregular heartbeat detection: Compute variability Mark abnormal patterns when variation greater than threshold Identify: skipped beats premature beats

here is my rpi code which receives the bpm:
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

app.use(express.json());

app.post("/api/bpm", (req, res) => {
    const { bpm } = req.body;

    if (!bpm) {
        return res.status(400).json({ error: "Missing bpm" });
    }

    console.log("Received BPM:", bpm);
    
    res.json({ status: "ok", received_bpm: bpm });
});

app.listen(5000, "0.0.0.0", () => {
    console.log("Server running on port 5000");
});





Prompt: 
how would i implement an LED to light up for a few seconds when an irregularity is detected?
