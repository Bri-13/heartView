Instructions to compile/execute code:
After downloading the zip file, open two terminals.

* sudo apt update
* sudo apt install python3-pip -y
* pip3 install flask numpy
Finally, run the code with the command: python3 heart_server.py.

In the second terminal, change the directory to heartView. Then, enter the following commands: 
* npm install
* npm run dev
Next, click on the website link that includes “localhost” and a port number.
